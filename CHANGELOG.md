## [3.4.0] - 2025-01-15

### üêõ Fixed

#### NKD Resource Orphan Detection Logic
- **Removed Incorrect Orphan Detection**: Removed inappropriate orphan detection logic for NKD resources
  - **Applications**: No longer marked as orphaned (they are primary resources)
  - **ApplicationSnapshots**: No longer marked as orphaned (they are backups meant to persist)
  - **AppProtectionPlans**: No longer marked as orphaned (they are configuration resources)
  
#### ApplicationSnapshotRestore Improvements
- **Fixed State Detection**: ApplicationSnapshotRestores now correctly display their state
  - Changed from checking non-existent `Complete` condition to using `status.completed` field
  - Now properly checks `ApplicationRestoreFinalised` condition for successful completion
  - States now correctly show: "Successful", "Failed", "In Progress", or "Unknown" (previously all showed "Unknown")
- **Corrected Orphan Logic**: Restores are now marked as orphaned only when completed successfully
  - Orphaned restores represent historical data that can be safely cleaned up
  - Updated tooltip to "Restore completed successfully - historical data"
- **Fixed Field Reference**: Corrected snapshot reference from `spec.snapshotName` to `spec.applicationSnapshotName`
- **Fixed Expand/Collapse**: Added ApplicationSnapshotRestores to the toggleAllSections array so it properly expands/collapses
- **Fixed Orphaned Filter**: Added ApplicationSnapshotRestores to the toggleOrphanedFilter function so it properly expands/collapses when filtering

### üîÑ Changed

- **Backend Data Processing** (`app/routes/main.py`):
  - Simplified Applications orphan detection (lines 612-622) - Always returns `orphaned: False`
  - Simplified ApplicationSnapshots orphan detection (lines 639-649) - Always returns `orphaned: False`
  - Simplified AppProtectionPlans orphan detection (lines 657-667) - Always returns `orphaned: False`
  - Enhanced ApplicationSnapshotRestores state detection (lines 669-721) - Now uses proper status fields and conditions
  
- **Frontend Display** (`templates/resources.html`):
  - Removed orphaned styling and badges from Applications (line 2051)
  - Removed orphaned styling and badges from ApplicationSnapshots (line 2099)
  - Removed orphaned styling and badges from AppProtectionPlans (line 2122)
  - Updated ApplicationSnapshotRestores orphaned badge tooltip (line 2079)
  - Added ApplicationSnapshotRestores to toggleAllSections array (line 2625) - Fixes expand/collapse functionality
  - Added ApplicationSnapshotRestores to toggleOrphanedFilter arrays (lines 2662, 2680) - Fixes orphaned filter expand/collapse

### üìä Impact

- **Accurate State Reporting**: ApplicationSnapshotRestores now show correct completion status
- **Reduced False Positives**: Eliminated incorrect orphan detection for NKD primary resources
- **Better Resource Management**: Only completed restores (historical data) are marked as orphaned
- **Clearer User Experience**: Orphaned badges now only appear where they make logical sense

### üîß Technical Details

- Modified `app/routes/main.py` - Fixed NKD resource orphan detection logic (lines 595-721)
- Modified `templates/resources.html` - Updated rendering functions for all four NKD resource types (lines 2040-2133)
- ApplicationSnapshotRestore state detection now properly handles:
  - `status.completed` boolean field
  - `ApplicationRestoreFinalised` condition for success
  - `Failed` condition for failures
  - `Progressing` condition for in-progress restores

  - Check both namespace-scoped RoleBindings and cluster-scoped ClusterRoleBindings
  - Service accounts used for authentication/authorization purposes are now properly recognized
  - Prevents false positives for service accounts used in RBAC but not directly by pods

### üêõ Fixed

- **UI Expansion Bug**: Fixed Deployments and StatefulSets not expanding when clicked in Resources page
  - Corrected DOM element ID references in `togglePodDetails()` function in `templates/resources.html`
  - Changed from `pod-details-${rowId}` to `${rowId}` pattern

  - `dashboard-admin-sa` (kubernetes-dashboard namespace) - Used by ClusterRoleBinding

### üîÑ Changed

- **Orphan Detection Logic** (`app/routes/main.py`): Enhanced service account orphan detection to check both usage patterns
  - Service accounts are checked against pod `spec.serviceAccountName` references
  - Service accounts are also checked as subjects in RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings

  - RBAC subjects (via RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings for authentication/authorization)
- **Better UX**: Resources page now properly expands/collapses deployment and statefulset details
- **Cleaner Dashboard**: Orphaned resources view now only shows truly orphaned resources

3. **Configuration**: Use `config.py` instead of hardcoded values
4. **Environment variables**: Create `.env` file for local development

#### For Operators:
1. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export DASHBOARD_USERNAME="your-username"
   export DASHBOARD_PASSWORD="your-password"
   export CLUSTER_NAME="your-cluster-name"
   export BIND_PORT=5001
   ```
